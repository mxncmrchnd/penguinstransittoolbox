## What kind of help is needed ?


This project doesn't aim to produce a groundbreaking package, as many GTFS packages already exist (and they are definitely better than this one). But instead, this is a project to put into practice several skills.
As such, the contributions needed are : 
- feedback on the overall code quality ;
- technical and grammatical fixes ;
- typo fixes.
